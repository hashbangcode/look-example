# Look Example

An example of a script that uses styles to make it appear that a face is looking at the mouse as it moves around a web page.

This has two examples.
- look_rectagle.html - Uses a simple bounding box technique to update the background position.
- Look_angle.html - Uses a angle calcualtion technique to update the background position.
